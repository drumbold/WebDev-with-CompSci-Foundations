This repo will hold my work throughout my time working through the ["Guide: Web Development with Computer Science Foundations - comprehensive path"] (https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516).

Thanks to P1xt for putting this together over at freeCodeCamp and MARKJ78 for porting the list to Trello to make tracking progress even easier.
